Boolean expressions are expressions that return either true or false when they are evaluated. In Java, boolean expressions can be used to see if certain variables or input are equal, greater than, less than, or related in some other way to another variable. Booleans are also a primitive data type in Java, and can be initialized with the following statement.

  boolean correct = true;
  boolean incorrect = false;
  
The variables correct and incorrect store the values of true and false, and display their corresponding values when printed to the terminal.
