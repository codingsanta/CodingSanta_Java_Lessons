To read input and output with java, first import the java.util.Scanner, which is the library used to read input in Java. Next, create a scanner object, and use the applicable methods to receive the input, stored into a variable. For example:
 
 Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
 
 int x = keyboard.nextInt();
