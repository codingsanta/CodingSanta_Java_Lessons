OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, and Java is an OOP language.

Traditional programming focuses around writing procedures or methods that preform operations on data.
OOP focuses on creating object that contain both data (variables) and methods.

There are many benefits to OOP vs Traditional Programming languages:
1) Faster and easier to execute
2) Clear program structure
3) Rids of the code of repitions and makes the code easier to modify
4) Allows the programmer to create fully reusable applications with less code and quicker development times

Classes and objects are the main aspects in OOP.
Class: Template for objects
Objects: Instances of classes

Example:

Class: Car
Objects(Brands of cars): BMW, Toyota, etc.


    An example of an object
    
    Main myObject = new Main();

It's important to remember that objects inherit all variables and methods from the class they are instances of. 
This allows us to call methods and use variables from different classes
